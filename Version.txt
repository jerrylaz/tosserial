ver 0.5.6 23-8-2023
- A workaround for a weird error where temp probe auto tx caused receive error of ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER which i do not know why.


ver 0.5.5 11-8-2023
- Optimized SyncRead() for speed.
- Added property SyncReadInProgress to indicate if a SyncRead() is taking place (True).

ver 0.5.4 17-5-2023
- Optimized WriteBuf() function to fix a bug in SyncRead() and OnReceived event firing at the same time.
- Upscale SyncRead() timer from milliseconds to microseconds in MS Windows for better receiving response.

ver 0.5.3 15-5-2023
- Added checksum function which auto insert checksum byte(s) in WriteHexStr(), and full send string returned.
- Overcome a bug which caused first time SyncRead() after port opened not able to receive data, but the data went to OnReceive event.
- Added function ReadBufAsHexStr() which directly reads a hex into hex string.

ver 0.5.2 24-6-2022
- Added support for setting serial port params (Parity, Stopbits) on LINUX.
- Added WriteHexStr(HexStr: String) which auto converts 'OF A1' to $OFA1 and write to com port

ver 0.5.1 13-6-2022
- Added function ReadBuf(var buf; BytesToRead: word; ATimeout: word): Integer which will block for a "ATimeout"
  period until the needed number of bytes have been read.

ver 0.5.0 3-6-2022
- Known bug: SyncRead cannot be use for reading > 1040 bytes at one read.
- Fixed a bug that will cause AVs when using the OnReceive event to receive strings as in below example.
  
  procedure TForm1.OSSerial1OnReceive(Sender: TObject);
  var s: String;
  begin
    s := OSSerial1.ReadString;
  end;

- Optimize Com Receive Thread. Much faster now compare to previous version.
- Now syncread() can work independently by itself to wait for com receive some data anywhere in the program.
  example:
          begin
            do_something();
            .
            .
            //need an input from the com port at this moment...
            if OSSerial1.SyncRead(5000) then begin //5 secs timeout
              s := OSSerial1.ReadString;
              if s = 'OK' then begin
                do_OK();
                Exit;
              end;
            end else begin
              WriteLn('Timeout');
            end;
            .
            .
            .
            do_something_else;
          end;


ver0.4.2 14-4-2021
- Fixed a bug which cannot receive a single byte data.

ver0.4 6-11-2019
-Supports changing COMMSTATE when comport is active.
-Supports function SyncRead (blocking) and ASyncRead (non-blocking) to direct receive data back to program flow.usage example: 
  		com.WriteString('some data');
		if com.SyncRead then //you can specify timeout. default is 500.
		  rxStr := com.ReadString;

for lenghty operation example: 
		com.WriteString('Get EEPROM dump');
		While not com.AsyncRead(ReceivedBytes, HasTimeout) do begin
		  WriteLn('Bytes rx: ' + IntToStr(ReceivedBytes));
		end;
		if HasTimeout then begin
		  WriteLn('Operation has timeout');
		end else begin
		  EEpromDump := com.ReadString;
		end;

-Supports '\n' and '\r' C-String escape code for the function com.WriteString.
 You need to enable by supplying an escape char to the function. You can specify any character to be the escape code.
example: com.WriteString('Some\r\nstring', '\'); 
	 
	output: Some
		string
